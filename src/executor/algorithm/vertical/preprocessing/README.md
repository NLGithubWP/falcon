## Pre-Processing

In machine learning, usually we need to select those features that are useful for
the prediction. For linear models, a typical method is to use weight of evidence 
(WOE) and information value (IV) for selecting features. 

In the vertical FL setting, the features are distributed among parties while the
label is held by only the active party. Similar to other vertical FL algorithms,
we use a hybrid of PHE and MPC method to compute WOE and IV. 

The detailed method will be added later.
